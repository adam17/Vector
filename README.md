# Vector

Simple (could it be more complex?) JavaScript class representing a vector in two-dimensional space.

It has two parameters: *x* and *y* (numbers), two methods: *plus* and *minus* (which take another vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors) and a property *length* that computes the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).
